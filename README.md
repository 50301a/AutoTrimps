Based on AutoTrimp-genBTC. Modified by Uni. <b>Not backwards compatible with AutoTrimps-genBTC due to optimized save format! Please beware and backup your AT configs!</b> Also, not guarranteed the work. The reason why I'm building a fork instead of submitting PRs is that I have no idea how it really works and need a way to crash test. Also I don't want to hold other maintainers from having to deal with the technical debt I cause. If any horrible code I wrote gets in your way, sorry!

I'm usually on zininzinin's AT chat. If I'm not online there or if you just want to yell at me about the script without any interference just PM me.

## Current Roadmap
- Implement stuff that I want to see which isn't already in genBTC
- Implement changes that others have requested and I feel are doable

## Script Installation
**Please backup your game via export before and during use to prevent losing your save due to corruption!**

**Please also backup your AT config, it will be converted into simplified format which is a NO RETURN PROCESS!**
