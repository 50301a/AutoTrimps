AutoTrimps - A Highly Extensive Idle Clicker Game Script

Code Execution Structure Behavior/Explanation:
=========================
A script bootstrap file userscript "install.user.js" is ran by Tampermonkeyed/Greasemonkeyed and installed into permanence on the browser extension. This loads AutoTrimps2.js. First it loads utils.js for some tools, then it loads the Settings UI and then it Loads the Graphs, This loads all the 17 submodules *.js files in the modules/ dir, in a particular order as listed. From that point, a timeout/interval loop is set up to launch the Main Game and Re-run the "Main Loop" every 100ms (10x a second) in sync with the Game Loop. Also the Graphs has its own identical tick count and loop. Each module function is called during the "Main Loop" generally one by one, sequentially, in a particular order, each cycle. There is no future state, just current. The past state is limited to anything we explicitly choose to keep around like in the graphs db or other variables.

Detailed Function Documentation (from 2016):
========================
The main loop consists of the following subroutines, all of which are enable-able/disable-able by their buttons.:
    workerRatios();         //"Auto Worker Ratios"
    buyUpgrades();          //"Buy Upgrades"
    autoGoldenUpgrades();   //"AutoGoldenUpgrades" (genBTC settings area)
    buyStorage();           //"Buy Storage"
    buyBuildings();         //"Buy Buildings"
    buyJobs();              //"Buy Jobs"
    manualLabor();          //"Auto Gather/Build"
    autoMap();              //"Auto Maps"
    manageGenes();          //"Genetecist Timer" / "Manage Breed Timer"
    autoPortal();           //"Auto Portal" (hidden until level 60)
    autoHeirlooms2();  or  autoHeirlooms(); //"Auto Heirlooms 2" (genBTC settings area) or //"Auto Heirlooms"
    toggleAutoTrap();       //"Trap Trimps"
    autoRoboTrimp();        //"AutoRoboTrimp" (genBTC settings area)
    autoNull();             //"Auto Upgrade Heirlooms" (genBTC settings area)
    autoLevelEquipment();   //"Buy Armor", "Buy Armor Upgrades", "Buy Weapons","Buy Weapons Upgrades"
    autoStance();           //"Auto Stance"
    betterAutoFight();      //"Better Auto Fight"
    prestigeChanging2();    //"Dynamic Prestige" (genBTC settings area)
    userscripts();          //Runs any user provided scripts - by copying and pasting a function named userscripts() into the Chrome Dev console. (F12)

Version Numbered Files (files needing version string during minor upgrades):
=================
.user.js
user.js
install.user.js
AutoTrimps2.js
Graphs.js
TODO: Should invent a tool/script to plug in the version numbers, changelogs, docs.

HTTPS Localhost Self serve - With Python 2:
==========================
import BaseHTTPServer, SimpleHTTPServer
import ssl
httpd = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('localhost', 4443), SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)
httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket (httpd.socket, certfile='./server.pem', server_side=True)
httpd.serve_forever()

HTTPS Localhost Self serve - With Python 3:
==========================
import logging
import os
import sys
import http.server
import socketserver
import ssl
logging.info('Server running...')
httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(('localhost', 4443), http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)
httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, certfile='./AutoTrimps.pem', server_side=True)
httpd.serve_forever()

//(make sure you generate a self-signed .PEM cert to serve.)

Some Files contain/require game-code overwrites that need to be periodically checked and maintained. These are undocumented. Some are for the GUI and some are in utils.js maybe some for the heirlooms, and also graph loot...
