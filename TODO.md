TODO LIST: 8/17/2016

Near Future:
------------
Essence graph
Add notes to graph runs.
 it doesnt go into the map bonus mode soon enough because of the fact that its gauging the zone on non-corrupted enemies
  //we will get at least 85 toxstacks from the 1st voidmap UNLESS we have overkill, then we dont get enough.

New Features To Add:
----------------
Documentation (started)
Update README (always do this)
Code Comments (getting better)


Bugs To Fix:
----------------

Bone Portal messes with graphs / Importing a savedgame in progress produces bad graphs


Other Improvements:
----------------
Void Map Farming
    - based on how much damage you do rather than your health/survival

Programming/CodeWise:
----------------------
Rewrite the automaps way of deciding/picking/buying/running maps.
Also while doing this, determine more refined rules for entering the 3 modes: want dmg/want health/farming
